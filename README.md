# CapstoneProject
My app "JokestersKingdom" for the final capstone project of the Udacity AND Nanodegree

The aim of my app is to create a community between funny people and jokesters.

Each user will have the ability to share their own jokes to the community which i called the
"Kingdom" and all these jokes will be displayed together in the “Jokes Feed” of the app
which will be common to aII the users.

It uses FirebaseAuth and FirebaseFirestore Libraries

Main Features of the app :
- Register/Login User
- Store jokes data and retrieve them in Firebase
- Store user data and display it in the user profil screen
- Like "feature" on jokes you like

## Design of the different screens of the app before coding
